#delay calculation
 Crystal frequency : 11.0592 MHz
  Clock frequency f= 11.0592/2 = 0.9216.MHz
 Time period of clock (T) = 1/f = 1/0.9216 MHz=1.085 msec
To get delay of specific time (say 1 sec): the loop 
Should be executed n times
        n=delay time in msec/clock time in u sec 

    n= 1000 msec/1.085 usec = 921.658


 Data to be loaded in timer :
  Data =FFFF-921.653
       =65536-921.653
       = 64614.34
       =Fc65 H
   Set TL=65H and TH=FCH
